# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project uses the Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes classifier to recognize handwritten digits from the scikit-learn load_digits dataset. It trains a model, evaluates accuracy, and saves it using Joblib. Future improvements include integrating deep learning and a GUI for real-time recognition.
